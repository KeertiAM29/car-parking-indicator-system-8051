# 🚗 Car Parking Indicator System using 8051

This project is an embedded automation system that uses the **8051 microcontroller**, **IR sensors**, a **stepper motor**, and an **LCD display** to manage and monitor parking slots efficiently. It detects vehicles and updates the gate and display system accordingly.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Manual parking systems often cause confusion, time waste, and human error. This project automates the vehicle entry/exit system and displays parking availability using simple embedded hardware.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect vehicles using IR sensors at entry/exit points
- Display available slots on an LCD
- Control gate using a stepper motor
- Restrict vehicle entry when parking is full

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Microcontroller**: AT89S52 (8051)
- **Programming Language**: Embedded C
- **Simulation Tool**: Keil µVision, Proteus
- **Platform**: Windows
